# Quokka Alias demo for ES6 + webpack

## Abstract

This demo is designed to show Quokka Alias import working with ES6.

Additionally, Quokka's local configuration is set up to import aliases from WebPack's config; see the `.quokka` file to see how.

For general setup advice, see the [readme](../README.md) in the repository root.


## Demo

First, install dependencies (Quokka plugin and language support):

```
npm install
```

Next, open `src/main.js` in your IDE.

Right click and choose **Start Quokka**.

You should see the following output in the Quokka panel:


```
Quokka #1

Hello ES6 + WebPack ! 
```
